[Live E-commerce website](https://evra-jewlry.vercel.app/) | [Evra_jewelry GitHub](https://github.com/KadamAmruta03/EVRA_JEWLRY)

Welcome to my personal portfolio and project showcase! This repository demonstrates my journey in web development and tech projects, highlighting my hands-on experience, skills, and academic achievements.

This portfolio is built using React, featuring multiple pages, reusable components, and a clean, responsive design. It is fully deployed on Vercel for live access.

## Project Overview
EVRA Jewelry is a modern, responsive e-commerce web application built with React.  
This project showcases my skills in **front-end development**, **state management**, and **dynamic UI design** while simulating a small-scale online jewelry store.  

**User Interaction Flow:**  
- **Browse Products:** Users can view a grid of jewelry products with images, prices, and stock availability.  
- **View Product Details:** Clicking on a product opens a detailed modal showing description, manufacturer, price, and stock.  
- **Add to Cart:** Users can add products to the shopping cart directly from the product card or the details modal. Stock decreases dynamically as items are added.  
- **Shopping Cart & Checkout:** Users can see the cart contents, remove items, and simulate payment using a checkout form.  
- **User Chat:** Users can interact with a chat component, select categories (e.g., Necklace, Bangles, Accessories), and type messages for queries or assistance.  

This flow ensures a realistic and interactive online shopping experience while demonstrating dynamic state handling and responsive design.
